      "abstract": "Under current law, certain boards of county commissioners must appoint county commissioner redistricting commissions to adopt plans to divide the relevant counties into as many county commissioner districts as there are county commissioners elected by voters of their district (plan). The bill requires these boards of county commissioners to appoint independent county commissioner redistricting commissions, modifies the criteria for who may serve on these commissions, and requires the boards of county commissioners to adopt a final plan that was one of the final plans approved by an independent county commissioner redistricting commission. The bill also removes the role of advisory committees in the process of adopting a plan and divides that role among staff and the independent county commissioner redistricting commissions.Further, the bill requires an independent county commissioner redistricting commission to adopt a numerical measure of county commissioner district competitiveness and to use that measure in determining county commissioner districts.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
