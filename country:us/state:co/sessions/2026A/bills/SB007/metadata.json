      "abstract": "The bill mandates that a health facility allow patients who are terminally ill and who are registered in the state's medical marijuana program to use medical marijuana within the health facility, subject to certain parameters. The bill requires that a health facility develop guidelines for the use of medical marijuana and impose restrictions on the usage and storage of medical marijuana to ensure the safety of others, safe facility operations, and compliance with other laws.The bill prohibits the department of public health and environment from requiring compliance with the bill as a condition for a health facility to obtain or renew a license or certification that it is required to carry to operate as a health facility. Lastly, the bill allows a health facility to suspend compliance with the bill's provisions in the event that, and only as long as, a listed federal entity takes an action that requires the health facility to suspend its compliance with the bill.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
