Current law also allows the department to retain 3% of the prepaid wireless trust cash fund to mitigate administrative costs. The money retained by the department is currently transmitted into multiple individual cost recovery cash funds that are used to mitigate the department's administrative costs of collecting those fees and charges. These cash funds include the oil and gas production fees collection fund, the enterprise per ride fees fund, and the retail delivery fees fund (cost recovery funds).The bill repeals each of these cost recovery funds and directs the state treasurer to transmit the money retained by the department to mitigate the department's administrative costs for all the programs into a single cost recovery cash fund, which is created in the bill.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
