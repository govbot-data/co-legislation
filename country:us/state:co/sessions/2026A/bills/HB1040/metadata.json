The counseling must take place regardless of whether the person is deemed competent to give consent.The bill prohibits sterilization against the person's will, regardless of whether the person is deemed competent to consent, unless maintaining fertility or a pregnancy would pose an imminent threat to the life or health of the person.The bill requires a petition for court-ordered sterilization to include a statement that the person has received counseling on the long-term impacts of sterilization and the less intrusive means available to prevent pregnancy.If a person expresses a desire to the court to maintain fertility and does not want to undergo sterilization, the bill prohibits a court from ordering sterilization unless sterilization is necessary to preserve the life or health of the person.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
