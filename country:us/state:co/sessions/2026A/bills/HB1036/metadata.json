      "abstract": "The bill authorizes a county or municipality (local government), after approval by the electors of the local government, to impose an excise or a property tax, or both, on vacant residential properties within the boundaries of the local government (local taxes on vacant residential properties) ( sections 1 and 3 of the bill). A local government may use the revenues collected from either tax only for affordable, attainable, or workforce housing. A county assessor has no duty in implementing local taxes on vacant residential properties, but in an assessor's discretion, the assessor may assist by providing data and information to a local government or local housing tax authority, and may enter into an intergovernmental agreement that provides for compensation in exchange for the assessor's assistance.The bill also creates a process for the creation of a local housing tax authority (authority) by intergovernmental agreement to allow 2 or more counties, cities and counties, or municipalities to form a joint taxing authority to collectively establish, levy, collect, and enforce local taxes on vacant residential properties within the boundaries of the authority ( section 2 ).(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
