      "abstract": "The bill creates the \"Colorado Mandatory Lethality Assessment Act\", which requires peace officers to conduct a lethality assessment when responding to a domestic violence incident and include the results of the lethality assessment in the incident report. If the lethality assessment indicates that an individual is a high-risk victim, or if a peace officer determines an individual is a high-risk victim based on the totality of the circumstances, the peace officer is required to immediately connect the victim to a victim's advocate either by phone or in person.The bill requires the attorney general's office, in coordination with a Colorado-based coalition that advocates for survivors of domestic violence, to develop a mandatory training for peace officers to learn how to administer the lethality assessment and provide victim referrals. The bill requires each law enforcement agency to ensure that each peace officer employed by the agency has completed the mandatory training.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
