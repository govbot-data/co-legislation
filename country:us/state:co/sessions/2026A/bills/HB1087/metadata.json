A public school, health-care provider, or a governmental entity is prohibited from withholding information from a minor's parent regarding the minor's express desire to transition the minor's biological sex.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bill prohibits state or federal funding, medicaid reimbursement, and health insurance coverage from being used to pay for a prohibited intervention. A person who, as a minor, was subjected to a prohibited intervention may bring a civil action within 20 years after attaining the age of 18 years against the person, health-care provider, or mental health professional who performed or provided the prohibited intervention.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bill requires a regulator to revoke a health-care provider's or mental health professional's license for performing or providing a prohibited intervention.
