The content creator must comply with the request within 72 hours. If the content creator fails to comply after 30 days, the individual may sue for various types of relief, and the online hosting platform must review and take reasonable steps to remove the content unless certain exceptions apply.The bill prohibits a person from financially benefiting from knowingly producing or distributing online content of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer. Exceptions apply for law enforcement, reporting unlawful activity, legal proceedings, and certain actions engaged in by online hosting platforms. Online hosting platforms are required to develop and implement a risk-based strategy to help mitigate risks related to the monetization of the intentional sexualization of known minors.A civil action may be filed on behalf of a minor for damages, including actual damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees, if a content creator fails to comply with specified provisions of the bill.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
