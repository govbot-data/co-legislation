The bill establishes remedial measures against a nursing facility that fails to discharge an individual on the discharge date due to a failure within the nursing facility's control or fails to cooperate in good faith with the state department to ensure long-term care services and supports are in place for the individual.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
