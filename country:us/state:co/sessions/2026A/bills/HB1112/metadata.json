The commission may assess and collect fees related to the regulation of class I, class IV, and class V injection wells. A person that willfully violates a rule, permit, authorization, or order of the commission related to these classes of injection wells commits a misdemeanor and is subject to certain penalties.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bill also grants the mined land reclamation board (board) authority over class III injection wells and allows the board to seek and adopt rules related to primacy from the EPA for class III injection wells. The board may assess and collect fees related to the regulation of class III injection wells. A person that violates a rule, permit, authorization, or order of the board related to class III injection wells or that operates a class III injection well without a permit from the board is subject to certain penalties. The bill also provides that a class III injection well is not eligible for an exemption from designated mining operation status, which status subjects the operator to certain rules adopted by the board.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
