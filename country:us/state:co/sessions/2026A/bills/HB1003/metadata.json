      "abstract": "Currently, the purpose of the small business recovery and resiliency loan program (program) is to support the state's recovery from the economic crisis caused by COVID-19 by supporting Colorado small businesses recovering from COVID-19. The bill modifies the purpose of the program to supporting Colorado's small businesses through the program.Currently, money in the small business recovery and resiliency fund (fund) may be used for specified purposes if the money from the fund is matched by money provided by other sources at a ratio of $1 of money from the fund to $4 of money from other sources. The bill changes this ratio to $1 from the fund to $1 from other sources. Once the money from the fund is matched by other sources and comprises a tranche, the bill specifies that the money from the tranche may be used for loans or to purchase participation interest in loans for businesses as determined by the program oversight board (board), including working capital and the purchase of equipment.Currently, principal and interest payments on a loan may be deferred for up to one year for circumstances of hardship created by the COVID-19 pandemic or based on ongoing economic conditions. The bill allows a deferral for circumstances of hardship and repeals the requirement that the hardship must be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or ongoing economic conditions.Currently, each tranche is subject to an initial period of time, as determined by the board, in which a portion of the money from the fund is allocated to each county, as determined by the board, based on specified criteria or a statutory formula. Currently, the money allocated to each county must be reserved for applications from eligible borrowers located in that county for the initial period of time. The bill repeals the requirement that the money is reserved for the initial period of time and that the money is allocated to a county. The bill requires each tranche of loan funding to be used to fund businesses across the state over the duration of the program. The program will track the distribution of capital to counties.The bill requires the state treasurer to transfer $5 million from the fund to the Colorado startup loan program fund on June 30, 2026.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
