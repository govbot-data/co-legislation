The form must include fields for the disclosure of certain information regarding a dementia care facility's dementia care services, including the facility's:Dementia training requirements for staff that are in addition to statutory training requirements;Guidelines for using restraints; andSecurity features and procedures for addressing the needs of residents with dementia.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bill authorizes the department to regularly review the form and update it as needed. After creating or subsequently updating the form, the department must provide the form to every dementia care facility in the state.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bill requires a dementia care facility to complete the form with responsive, accurate, and complete information regarding the facility's dementia care services.

A facility may not require that a registered nurse be on site as a prerequisite to an LPN or CNA administering medication by injection.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bill also adds all facilities and agencies licensed and regulated by the department to the list of specified facilities that can have a medication administration program.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sections 2 and 3 modify the scope of practice for CNAs to include the administration of medication by injection as authorized under the bill.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
