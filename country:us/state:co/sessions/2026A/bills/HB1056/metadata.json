      "abstract": "The bill creates the \"Prescription Drug Optimized Sourcing Transparency and Integrity Act\" to prohibit a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) or a health-care consultant from knowingly making or disseminating false or misleading statements or claims to a self-insured employer or policyholder about the legality or safety of a lawful prescription drug optimized sourcing program established by a pharmacy stewardship program.Upon written request by a self-insured employer, a PBM or health-care consultant is required to provide certain cost information for each prescription drug dispensed under the health benefit plan.The prohibition and information-sharing provisions of the bill do not restrict or limit the rights of a self-insured employer to purchase prescription drugs through and contract for a lawful prescription drug optimized sourcing program. The bill also recognizes that a pharmacy stewardship program is an effective cost-containment tool and is authorized when implemented in compliance with federal law and with the bill.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
