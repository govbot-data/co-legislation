If the court issues an order granting the landlord possession of the premises, the record is no longer a suppressed court record unless the parties agree that the record remain suppressed. Under the bill, such a court record remains suppressed unless it concerns a substantial violation of the lease. A court may publish a judicial opinion concerning the action if the names and identifiers of the parties are anonymized.The bill requires a landlord to provide a tenant at least one rent payment option that does not require the tenant to access an online portal or pay a transaction fee.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
