      "abstract": "Under current law, the general assembly, the secretary of state, and each political party must ensure that it remains an option for a candidate in the state to access the ballot through the caucus process or any future alternative process that is accessible to persons with disabilities. A political party must also ensure that any person, upon request, is able to participate in a precinct caucus or a party assembly with the use of a video conferencing platform or alternative means of participation. The failure of any political party to make a reasonable effort to comply with these accessibility requirements constitutes discrimination on the basis of disability in a place of public accommodation.The bill clarifies that these duties are duties of the state political party and that a person who is subjected to a violation of a state political party's duties regarding these accessibility requirements may file suit against the state political party. An individual, including a member of or volunteer for a political party, or a local political party may not be held liable for a violation of the state political party's duties regarding these accessibility requirements.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
